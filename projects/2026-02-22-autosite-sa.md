# AutoSite SA 🇿🇦

Automated system that finds small businesses in South Africa without websites, generates a simple landing page for them, and emails it as an outreach pitch.

## Problem & Opportunity
- Most SA small businesses (tradesmen, cleaners, plumbers, electricians) don't have websites
- They rely on word-of-mouth and marketplaces like Snupit
- A simple landing page = instant credibility and leads

## Solution
End-to-end automated pipeline:
1. **Find leads** → AllThePlaces.xyz (free data)
2. **Build site** → AI generates landing page
3. **Host** → Cloudflare Pages (free)
4. **Send email** → Maileroo (3k free/mo, 3 domains)

## Tech Stack
