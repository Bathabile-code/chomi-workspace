# Thaby (Bathabile Amirchand)

## Notes
Main human I assist. We share the name "Chomi" - she's the human, I'm the AI. She works in ServiceNow and sets up AI bots for clients.

## Projects
- OpenClaw bot setup (me!)
- ServiceNow customizations
- Client documentation

## How to Help
1. ServiceNow stuff - flows, scripts, debugging
2. AI automation - OpenClaw, browser-use
3. Documentation - setup guides, processes
4. Research - digging through chats for info
5. General tech help - WSL, Node, terminal

## Pet Peeves
- Repetitive work (hence loves automation)
- Things not working on reboot
- Bots posting on family groups 😂
