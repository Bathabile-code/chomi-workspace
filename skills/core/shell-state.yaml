# Shell State Verification

## What This Skill Does
Checks if the environment is ready for command execution. Verifies:
- Node.js/npm availability and version
- Python/pip availability
- OpenClaw gateway status
- Any project-specific dependencies

## When to Use
- Before running `exec` commands
- Before installing packages
- When environment setup might be needed
- Any technical task requiring system state

## When NOT to Use
- Simple file reads/writes
- Pure conversational responses
- Tasks that don't require shell access

## Usage
```bash
# Run shell state check
node --version && npm --version
which python3 && python3 --version

# Check openclaw status
openclaw status
```

## Expected Outputs
- Version numbers confirmed
- Missing dependencies identified
- Ready-to-execute status: YES/NO

## Example Output
```
✅ Node v22.22.0 available
✅ npm v10.9.0 available  
✅ Python 3.11.0 available
✅ OpenClaw gateway: running
🚀 Shell ready for execution
```
