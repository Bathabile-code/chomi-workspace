# Integrate x-research-but-cheaper skill

## Project Overview
Zero-dependency X/Twitter research tool that costs $0.15/1k tweets vs $100+/month for official API. Enables direct X research from Telegram.

## Goal
Build foundation for automated X research to support #BuildInPublic content and growth strategy.

## Progress
- [x] Cloned repo to ~/.openclaw/x-research-but-cheaper
- [x] Read README and SKILL.md to understand tool
- [x] Configured TwitterAPI.io key
- [x] Tested search functionality - working
- [ ] Run daily research queries (rate limited)
- [ ] Wire into OpenClaw skills for automation
- [ ] Document for #BuildInPublic

## Daily Research Tasks
Each day, run these 3 searches and summarize:
1. "OpenClaw skills" — what skills/tools is X building?
2. "build in public AI agent" — what's people documenting?
3. "AI agent productivity" — what workflows are shared?

**BLOCKED:** TwitterAPI.io rate limiting (free tier = 1 req/5s). Need to either:
- Wait for cooldown (尝试多次后仍被限制)
- Upgrade to paid tier for higher limits

## Research Summary (2026-02-20)

### OpenClaw Trends
- Hardware plays: Raspberry Pi + Mac Mini for agent deployments
- Content engagement: "OpenClaw content is RUINING X" (high engagement)
- Knowledge drops: @milesdeutscher sharing 3 months of tips
- AGI potential: "5 things to turn OpenClaw into AGI"

### AI Agent Orchestration
- Multi-agent coordination becoming key differentiator
- x402 payments for agents (Base chain)
- OpenAI + OpenClaw acquisition seen as strategic

## Gaps Identified
- Beginner guides underserved
- African/SA perspective missing
- ServiceNow + AI agents = unique combo

## Priority Skills
1. Watchlist automation
2. Weekly research digest
3. Profile enrichment
