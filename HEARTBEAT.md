# Heartbeat (runs every 30 min)

## Rotation (pick ONE per cycle, rotate through them)

**Note:** Skip if active research/ongoing tasks are running — give them a pass!

1. **Drift Check** — verify AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, MEMORY.md are intact and consistent
2. **Quick X Scan** — check mentions of @ThabiTechy or #BuildInPublic trends (use Exa search)
3. **Message Summarize** — summarize unread Telegram/WhatsApp messages and flag anything urgent
4. **BRAIN.md Scan** — read BRAIN.md, flag stale items (>24h), check blocked list, propose actions
5. **Session Save** — save current session context, extract any new lessons learned, update MEMORY.md if needed
6. **GitHub Backup** — commit workspace changes to git with meaningful messages

## Morning Routine (9am SAST - Daily)

**Skill Discovery + Research:**
1. Use Exa web search to find 1-2 cool OpenClaw skills/articles
2. Present findings with links and pitch
3. If approved → flag for installation

## Crons to Create
- 9am SAST daily: Morning skill research
- 9pm SAST daily: Evening wrap-up

## Evening Wrap-Up (9pm SAST - Daily)

**End-of-Day Ritual:**
1. **Ongoing Research Check** — skip heartbeat actions if active research/tasks are running (give them a pass)
2. **Session Flush** — save any pending context from today's sessions to MEMORY.md
3. **Lessons Check** — scan ~/ChomiVaultSetup/lessons/ for any missed learnings, merge into MEMORY.md if valuable
4. **Missed Tasks Audit** — scan sessions/transcripts for tasks that weren't posted to the task board, add them even if complete
5. **GitHub Backup** — commit all workspace changes with clear messages:
   - Document what was worked on
   - Note any new lessons or decisions
   - Push to remote for safety
6. **Task Cleanup** — mark today's completed tasks in ~/ChomiVaultSetup/tasks/
7. **Tomorrow Prep** — flag any incomplete items that need attention

This keeps me sharp and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks! 💪
